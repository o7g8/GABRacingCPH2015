# GABRacingCPH2015

An exercise from Global Azure Bootcamp 2015 in Copenhagen.

Goal of the exercise is to create  Global Azure Bootcamp Racing Game Website
location in Copenhagen which displays the top lap times and telemetry for
Copenhagen participants.

The website can then be deployed to Microsoft Azure App Services, allowing 
for attendees at that location to compete with each other and share the results
on-line.
